In this project users will be redirected to a landing page of Aloft Hotels. 
Here users can rate the hotel accordingly throught the stars. |
If the users rate 3 stars then a dropdown feedback form will appear and user can fill the form and submit it. 
If the users rate 4 or 5 stars then the users will be redirected to the location of the hotel via Google Maps.
